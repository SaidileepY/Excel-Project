# Excel-Project
In this Project we took data from Kaggle whi has purchased bikes in different regions. First we cleaned the data and then removed duplicates, unwanted characterstics and arranged the data in a clean and understanding manner and then designed Pivot tables and created pictorial representation of the data in the table. Finally created a Dashboard.
